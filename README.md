# Ground Grid
Keep the core and rewrite the program to remove dependencies required by [GroundGrid](https://github.com/dcmlr/groundgrid) like: ROS, PCL, tf and grid map. The update version is compatible with more operation system and more streamlined.

ðŸ“œ ChangeLog
- 2024-07-31: Ectracted useful function from "grid_map" library to local GridMap.h. GroundSegmentation::filter_cloud and GroundSegmentation::insert_cloud are on going
- 2024-08-06: Basic structure has been built.Rewrote kitti_data_publish from python to c++ to read and store velodyne, label, calib and poses data. Implemented trasformation based on Eigen and get rid of "tf".

## Problems Meet
1. If functions in class are defined in source file, they cannot be found. If defined directly in head files, everthing works. If the functions don't belong to a class like bigFind() shown in test.cpp and test.h, it also works.
